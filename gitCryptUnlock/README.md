# Git-Crypt Unlock

GitHub action for unlocking files encrypted using Git-Crypt on your repository.

## Usage

To use this action, you need a GPG key, its grip and passphrase on the secrets section of your repository.

- `GPG_KEY_GRIP` = `The sub key-grip`
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` = `Base64 encoded version of the private key`
- `GPG_KEY_PASS` = `Key passphrase`

[Here is how to get the values of the required secrets](SETUP_KEYS.md)

## Example

```yml
name: Test with Git-Crypt Unlocked
on: 
  push:
      branches:    
          - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Git-Crypt Unlock
      uses: zemuldo/git-crypt-unlock@v2.0
      env: 
        GPG_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        GPG_KEY_GRIP: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY_GRIP }}
        GPG_KEY_PASS: ${{ secrets.GPG_KEY_PASS }}
    # Any actions below here will have files have been decrypted.
    # And ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
